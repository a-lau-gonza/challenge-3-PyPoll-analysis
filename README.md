# PyPoll: Pythons on a Poll

## Overview of Election Audit
This election audit analysis is a test on our skills in Python to execute code that can organize, format, display, and save a final summary of the findings in a real life example of vote counting. The code must transform from a list of commands to a full fledged final data layout of the results in a text file ready for analysis.
